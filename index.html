        <h1>My Favorite Places Around My House</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my blog of my favorite and unique place that I go to everyday.</p>

            <h2>
                The Moon Cafe
            </h2>
            <p>
                Moon Tea House is my cozy go-to study sanctuary, complete with comfortable seating,
                a mellow atmosphere, and the enticing aroma of freshly brewed tea.
                I’m especially hooked on their Hawaiian Light beverage, its bright,
                refreshing flavors keep me energized during long study sessions, 
                and I never leave without a scoop of their indulgent milk tea ice cream.

            <h2>
                Hmart Supermarket
            </h2>
            <p>
                When cravings strike for quick, affordable meals or hard-to-find Asian groceries,
                Hmart is where I head. From ready-to-eat sushi and comforting Korean dishes to
                an extensive selection of skincare products, this bustling market has everything I need.
                It’s no wonder it’s my favorite Asian store in the city; I can easily pick up dinner, snack on the go,
                and browse new skincare finds all in one visit.

            <h2>
                Stampede Park
            </h2>
            <p>
                Just a short distance away, Stampede Park stands as Calgary’s hub for year-round excitement.
                The venue hosts concerts, sporting events, trade shows, and more, bringing the community together
                for large-scale gatherings. But the real highlight is every July, when the city comes alive for the Calgary Stampede,
                a legendary festival celebrating rodeo, live music, carnival attractions, and the warm spirit of Western hospitality.
